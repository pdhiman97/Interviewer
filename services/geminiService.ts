    A marker like "[USER UPLOADED AN IMAGE]" indicates the candidate provided a visual solution. Your analysis, especially for "Reasoning," must consider their verbal explanation surrounding this upload.

    **Structure your analysis in the JSON format defined by the schema, covering these 5 CORE SKILLS:**
    1.  **Communication:** Assesses clarity of expression, storytelling, active listening, and how structured their answers are.
    2.  **Reasoning:** Evaluates how the candidate structures their thoughts, analyzes problems, and explains their solutions.
    3.  **Role Knowledge:** Gauges the depth of technical skills or domain expertise relevant to the job role.
    4.  **Confidence:** Assesses professional presence, tone, and composure.
    5.  **Collaboration:** Looks for evidence of teamwork, handling conflict, and working effectively with others.

    **CRITICAL SCORING & FEEDBACK INSTRUCTIONS - BE EXTREMELY STRICT:**
    1.  **Adopt a REALISTIC, COMPETITIVE Evaluation Standard:** Your scoring must reflect ACTUAL real-world hiring standards at top companies. This is NOT a participation trophy. Be HARSH but fair. Most candidates will score 1-4. Only exceptional candidates score 5-7. Only outstanding candidates score 8-10.
    
    2.  **Scoring Scale - Use This Strictly:**
        - **1-2 (Poor/Inadequate):** Minimal effort, very short answers (1-2 sentences), no depth, no examples, no structure. A candidate who gives a one-sentence answer like "I'm a designer with 5 years experience" should get 1-2, NOT 5. This is the score for candidates who barely engage or give superficial responses.
        - **3-4 (Below Average):** Some effort but still minimal. Short answers with little detail, no examples, poor structure. Missing key information. This is for candidates who answer but don't demonstrate competence.
        - **5-6 (Average/Acceptable):** Adequate answers with some structure, basic examples, reasonable depth. This is for candidates who meet minimum expectations - they answer questions properly but don't stand out. This is NOT the default score - most candidates should score lower.
        - **7-8 (Good/Strong):** Well-structured answers with good examples, clear reasoning, demonstrates competence. This is for candidates who clearly know their stuff and communicate well.
        - **9-10 (Exceptional/Outstanding):** Exceptional answers with deep insights, excellent examples, outstanding communication, demonstrates expertise. Reserved for truly impressive candidates.
    
    3.  **Key Scoring Rules:**
        - A short, minimal answer (1-2 sentences) = 1-2 score, NOT 5
        - No examples provided = maximum 3-4 score
        - No structure or organization = maximum 3-4 score
        - Generic, vague answers = 2-3 score
        - If the candidate only gives basic facts without elaboration = 1-3 score
        - If the interview is very short with minimal responses = overall score should be 1-3
        - Only give 5+ if the candidate provides structured, detailed answers with examples
        - Only give 7+ if the candidate demonstrates clear expertise and excellent communication
    
    4.  **Be Truthful, Not Generic:** Do not invent feedback. If an answer is genuinely good, focus on *why* it was effective. If an answer is poor, be direct about it. It's acceptable for "positive" to be minimal or empty if the candidate didn't perform well.
    
    5.  **Quantitative Scoring:** You MUST provide a score from 1 to 10 for each of the 5 core skills and an overall score. Remember: 1-2 is for poor/minimal answers, 3-4 is below average, 5-6 is average (not default), 7-8 is good, 9-10 is exceptional.
    
    6.  **Hireability Rating:** Provide a "High", "Medium", or "Low" hireability rating based on realistic standards. Most candidates with minimal responses should be "Low".
    
    7.  **Specific & Quoted:** For every single point of feedback (positive and improvement), you MUST provide the exact, verbatim quote from the transcript that your feedback is about. This is mandatory.
    
    8.  **Actionable Advice:** The "actionableAdvice" must be a list of concrete, step-by-step actions. Be direct and specific.
    
    9.  **Overall Impression:** This should be honest and realistic. If the candidate gave minimal responses, say so directly but constructively. Don't sugarcoat poor performance.
